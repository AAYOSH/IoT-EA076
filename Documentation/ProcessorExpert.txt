Module "PC"        (component AsynchroSerial)
   - PC_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - PC_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar method 
                only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be stored. 
                Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is available 
                only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - PC_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental error), 
                otherwise it returns an error code (it does not wait for data).  This method is available only if non-zero 
                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters.
   - PC_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output 
                buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.
   - PC_ClearRxBuf -Clears the receive buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the input buffer is defined 
                and the receiver property is enabled.
   - PC_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - PC_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled.
   - PC_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.

Module "ESP"       (component AsynchroSerial)
   - ESP_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - ESP_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - ESP_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled.
   - ESP_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.

Module "MCUC1"     (component McuLibConfig)
   - MCUC1_Init -Driver initialization method
   - MCUC1_Deinit -Driver deinitialization method

Module "LEDR"      (component LED)
   - LEDR_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LEDR_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LEDR_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LEDR_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LEDR_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LEDR_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - LEDR_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LEDR_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "LEDG"      (component LED)
   - LEDG_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LEDG_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LEDG_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LEDG_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LEDG_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LEDG_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - LEDG_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LEDG_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "LEDB"      (component LED)
   - LEDB_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LEDB_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LEDB_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LEDB_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LEDB_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LEDB_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - LEDB_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LEDB_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.
